# Disease-Prediction-using-ML
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of diseases based on various health-related attributes. The model uses supervised learning techniques to classify disease outcomes from patient data. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), a popular platform for data science and machine learning challenges.
